<h1>Book/Blog Recommendations</h1>

<p>
  Following is a list of my 10 most favorite non-fiction books and blogs,
  which I can highly recommend to practically anyone. When thoroughly studied and applied,
  I find they provide power to drastically improve your life.
</p>

<p>
  I list them by topic, which are areas of life that I am currently most focused on -
  namely software engineering (my profession), personal finance and happiness and achievement.
</p>

<p>
  Some of the entries contain a link to a document with my notes on the material -
  feel free to use those in any way.
