      I love my <strong>family</strong> - my life partner Adéla and my one-year-old son Timotej.

      I have spent considerable amount of time, in the past few years,
      exploring the area of <strong>personal finance</strong> and <strong>investment</strong>,
      self-sufficient living and financial independence.
